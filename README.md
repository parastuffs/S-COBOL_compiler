Note from the UV
-----
I want you produce a similar work that the one during the exercise session about the semantic analysis.
That is all actions you add in order to 
1. resolve identifier
2. any update on the table of symbols
3. type checking
4. checking constant

You can see these actions as all actions that will report an error (or a warning if you provide a default behavior)
